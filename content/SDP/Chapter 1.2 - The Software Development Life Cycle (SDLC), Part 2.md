The [[Chapter 1.1 - The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)#The **<u>Planning & Requirement Analysis</u>** Phase|SDLC phases]] we went through are not exactly linear all the time, meaning that in some (most) cases, the phases could be in a different order, or even repeated. There are, however, a few sets of unique configurations of the phases. These are called SDLC Models.



## The Waterfall Model

Perhaps the simplest model, The Waterfall Model is *a linear* model, meaning that it is structured in a way such that <u>a phase cannot be started if the last one is still unfinished.</u>

It usually goes like this:

- Requirement collection/analysis
	  
	- Feasibility study
		  
		- Design
			
			- Implementation/Coding
				  
				- Deployment
					  
					- Maintenance



So, what makes The Waterfall Model good?

- It's <u>very simple and understandable</u>
- It's <u>rigid</u>, meaning that it's very <u>easily manageable</u>
- Phases are <u>done one at a time</u>, and are <u>clearly defined</u>
- A good Model for <u>small</u>, indie projects.

### Reading Edition(if you want to :} ):
- The Waterfall Model is ***Simple and Easy to Understand and Use***, not only that, this model is ***Easy to manage due to its rigidity as each  phase has specific deliverables and a review process***. This Model is Mostly ***well Suited for smaller projects as their requirements are very well understood*** and concise. Using this method is great as it ***has Clearly Defined Stages*** that helps with the process.
###


Then, what makes The Waterfall Model bad?

- No actual working software is <u>produced until late into the cycle</u>
	- This is because all of the 'theoretical' phases (requirement gathering, designing, etc.) are done earlier than the 'practical' stuff.
- Quite <u>risky and uncertain</u>
- <u>Difficult to measure progress</u> within each phase
- Unsuitable for more <u>complicated, object-oriented</u> projects that are <u>long and ongoing</u>

### Reading Edition(if you want to :} ):

- Although the Waterfall Model has its Pros it would naturally have Cons as well. A thing about the Waterfall Model is that ***No working software is  produced until the later stage during the life cycle***,  this also amounts to ***High Amounts of Risks and Uncertainty*** as there is no telling if there will be a problem with the End Result. The Waterfall Models works great with  smaller projects but is ***not a great model for Complex and object-oriented projects*** due to its inflexibility of not overlapping in phases. This Model is a ***Poor Model for long and  ongoing projects*** due to the risk of not being able to view the product till the final stages, this also makes it ***difficult to measure the progress within the stages*** of the Waterfall model.

## The Agile Model

This SDLC Model is a <u>combination of iterative and incremental processes</u>.
<sup>These specific words are apparently really important and cannot be paraphrased.</sup>

Essentially what this means is that this model focuses going through a *repeated cycle* where for each loop, a *new iteration or 'build' of the software is finished that builds on the last iteration of the software.* 

(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development))



Examples of The Agile Model are:

- Lightweight 
	- Scrum
	- Lean
	- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Fuller
	- DSDM Atern
	- Agile Unified Process (AUP)



So, what makes The Agile Model good?
- Easy to manage
- Gives flexibility to developers
- Good model for environments that change steadily
- Minimal rules, documentation easily employed
- Is a very realistic approach to software development
- Enables concurrent development and delivery within an overall planned context.

### Reading Edition(if you want to :} ):
-  The Agile Model is ***Easy to manage*** Because it ***gives flexibility to developers***. This model is a ***good model for environments that change steadily*** due to its iterative and incremental process and is also a ***very realistic approach to software development***. Because of the Agile Model it ***Enables concurrent development and delivery within an overall planned context***, and because of Agile' use of ***minimal rules, documentation can be easily employed***.
###


Then, what makes The Agile Model bad?
- Agile model brought agility but it’s lost on operations so there is no speed in agile practices
- Considerable amount of skills & training are required for successful implementation
- Depends heavily on customer interaction, so if customer is not clear, team can be driven in the wrong direction
- Organizational transformation
- Lack of necessary documentation
- Less predictability

### Reading Edition(if you want to :} ):
-  However just like the Waterfall Model, The Agile Model also has its flaws. The ***Agile Model brought agility but it's lost on operations so there is no speed in agile practices***,  plus the need to have ***Considerable amount of skills and Training that are required for successful implementation***. Another Downside of Agile is that it also ***Heavily depends on customer interaction***, so if the customer is not clear, the team can be driven in the wrong direction. With the ***lack of necessary documentation*** and with ***less predictability***, this makes agile seem unfit without proper documentation. Agile lacks ***Organizational transformation*** as well, a strategic method of getting an organization from where it is now to where it will be in the future

## The DevOps Model

What is the DevOps Model?:

DevOps is a software development method which focuses on communication, integration and collaboration among IT Professionals to enable rapid deployment of products.

| DevOps | =   | Development + Operations |
| ------ | --- | ------------------------ |

DevOps is a Practice of Bringing Development and Operations teams Together

The 7 Stages in the DevOps Life Cycle:  

1. Continuous Development

	2. Continuous Integration

		3. Continuous Testing

			4. Continuous Monitoring

				5. Continuous Feedback

					6. Continuous Deployment

						7. Continuous Operations




So, what makes The DevOps Model good?
- Faster Delivery of Features
- More Stable operating Environments
- Improved communication and collaboration
- More time to innovate (rather than fix/maintain)



### Reading Edition(if you want to :} ):

With the Aid of the DevOps Model, it provides the team with a ***faster delivery of features***. The DevOps Model also provides ***more stable operating environment***s as well as ***improved communication and collaboration*** between the development and operations teams. This model also provides teams with ***More time to innovate rather than to fix or maintain problems*** that arises.

### 



Then, what makes The DevOps Model bad?
- DevOps professional or expert's developers are less available
- Developing with DevOps is expensive
- Adopting new DevOps technology into the industries is hard to manage in short time
- Lack of DevOps knowledge can be a problem in the continuous integration of automation projects
 

### Reading Edition(if you want to :} ):

Like the Waterfall Model and the Agile Model, the DevOps Model also has its drawbacks. Due to the ***lack of less readily available DevOps professionals and expert's***, it is hard for DevOps to operate properly. The ***Development of DevOps is also quite expensive***, due to the automation and other software tools required and other operational costs adding up quickly. The ***Adoption of New DevOps Technology into industries is also hard to manage in a small time frame***. In addition, the ***lack of DevOps knowledge can be a problem in the continuous integration of automation projects***.

That should be it for everything. See you guys in the next few chapters, where we will be going in-depth about each phase of an SDLC.
