"I look high, I look low, I'm lookin' everywhere I go"

Remember these two? Yeah, they're back.

### Refresher

UI (User Interface) is <u>the point of interaction between the user and the system.</u> It is where the user can essentially tell the system to do stuff. Examples of UI elements are buttons, input boxes, colors, etc.


UX (User Experience) refers to <u>the whole general experience a user has while using the product.</u> It is how easy or difficult it is to use the system.

It is UX Designers who <u>design the prototype wireframe of the product</u>.


We can look at the Obsidian app as an example for these two in play. Obsidian's graph view makes it *very easy to see which notes are linked to where (UI)*, and hence makes using **this app an enjoyable an cohesive experience (UX)**.


Common types of UI are:
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
	- The most common UI. It provides a set of elements the user can interact with, such as buttons. Systems with a GUI include YouTube, Windows, Obsidian, ITELMS.
	  
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
	- The CLI is mostly used for developers or people who know more about what they are doing. Usually used for back-end developing and troubleshooting. The most common software with a CLI is your command prompt, or 'cmd'.
	  
- Voice-Enabled User Interface (VEUI)
	- This one is mostly for accessibility or convenience. Some apps like YouTube have a voice-enabled feature that recognises spoken words and inputs it to the search bar.

## Storyboarding

Storyboards are early visual representations of a sequence of events, broken down into individual panels. You can think of them as short, lo-fi comics.

Storyboards are mainly used by filmmakers and directors, but who says they can't be used for software development?

Storyboards have 3 main elements:

- Scenario
	- The overall situation. The roles that correspond to the storyboard are specified at the top of the storyboard, as well as a short description of the scenario itself

- Visuals
	- The primary content of the storyboard, visuals are the panels that show each individual step of the scenario. They can be sketches, illustrations or photos.

- Captions
	- Captions accompany each individual visual. They explain each visual in more detail. They are usually concise.


Storyboards are useful particularly to *software devs* as they get them and their teams to see <u>the problem faced and possible solutions.</u> They help describe the user's problems as well as UX ideas and UI design.

Storyboards have the same structure as our old comprehension exercises from primary school, i.e this:

### Storyboards in UI and UX Design

Storyboards also come in use for UI/UX Design.

The 3 main layouts we are concerned with are:

- Linear
	- Where the path is simple and linear. You can think of it as walking, where you can only take one step forwards or backwards at a time.

- Hierarchical
	- Where there is a main page with sub pages. The sub pages have their own sub pages. You can think of this as a tree, or a pyramid.

- Non-Linear
	- It looks like a spider-web! Pages link to each other in a non-structured manner.

## Process of UI/UX Designing, From The Top!

As in the ITELMS Chapter, we will be using an example where you are designing a food application.

- Discover Users
- Define User Problem
- Gather User Requirements
	- Usually only mandatory at this stage
- Sketch Design of App
- Design App Navigation Wireframe
- Gather Some More User Requirements
	- Desirable, Optional and Possible Future Enhance
- Design Interface With Software (Adobe XD, etc)
- Finalise UI Design To Show Flow Of Application.
