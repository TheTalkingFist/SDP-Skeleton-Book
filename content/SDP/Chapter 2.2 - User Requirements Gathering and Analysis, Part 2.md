## Methods of Gathering User Requirements

###### •User survey 
###### •User interview 
###### •User existing documents review 
###### •User existing software review 
###### •Study user-supplied documentation

## User Survey

Definition: ***A User Survey is a Form of Questioning.***

So, what are its Advantages?

• Can be <u>conducted easily</u> 
• Can <u>reach many people with low cost</u>

Well, a User Survey Can be conducted easily and can reach many people with low or minimal cost.

The, what are its Disadvantages?

• Responses may not be useful
Obviously, Reponses may not be useful or what you are looking for.


## Visualise Survey Data

Pretty Self Explanatory, Visualising the data you got.

## User Interview

Definition: ***A User Interview can be conducted one on one or in a small group***

So, what are its Advantages?

• <u>Interviewer can guide interviewee during the interview</u> 
• <u>Encourages contact between developers and users</u>

Within the User Interview, the interviewer can guide the interviewee during the interview. This also encourages contact between developers and users

Then, what are its Disadvantages?

• <u>Time consuming</u>

Well, in a bigger firm or just by getting public opinion on the product/software, doing the User interview can be time consuming and may result in more detailed reviews in quantity fewer than expected.

## Existing Documents Review

Definition: ***An Existing Documents Review, Reviews data. The data can be reviewed by hardcopy, electronically or softcopy.***

This may include:

◦ reports, 
◦ program logs, 
◦ meeting minutes, 
◦ newsletters, and 
◦ marketing materials

So, what are its Advantages?

• <u>Relatively inexpensive</u>
• <u>Good source of background information</u>

The Existing Documents Review is relatively inexpensive meaning that the company is able to save funds for the future as well. It also is a good source of background information.    

Then, what are its Disadvantages?

• <u>Information may be incomplete or inaccurate</u>

The Downside of the Existing Documents Review is that information submitted may sometimes be false or other times not correct.

## Existing Software Review

Definition: ***The Existing Software review is the verification of both the functional and non-functional requirements.***

So, what are its advantages?

• <u>Identify design defects </u>
• <u>Highlights areas of existing system for improvement</u>

Using Existing Software Review, it is able to identify defects of the design within the software system as well as highlight the areas within the existing system that can be improved.

Then, what are its Disadvantages?

• <u>Time consuming to review the code </u>
•<u> Increased project implementation cost if the developers’ time has to be paid to review</u>

However, using the Existing software review, it often takes awhile to review the code and check for its defects and finding areas for improvement. And the implementation costs that will be added on if the developer has to be paid to review it.

## Study User-Supplied Documentation

So, what are its Advantages?

◦ <>No time commitment from users is required <>
◦ <u>Good for learning about :
   ◦ procedures, 
   ◦ regulations, and 
   ◦ standards</u>

Studying the user-supplied documentation has its perks. There is no time limit required from the users and that this documentation is great for learning about the procedures, regulations and standards that are happening then.

Then, what are its Disadvantages?

◦ Day-to-day work may differ from documented procedures

However, the documented procedures might be different day-to-day as most parts of the software may not include the documented procedures included in the User-Supplied Documentation

## Software Requirements Document(SRD)

Definition: A Software Requirements Document is an **Official Document** of:
      ◦ what is required of the system developers, and 
      ◦ specifies <u>WHAT the system should do</u> rather than HOW it should do.

This includes both the:
   ◦ user requirements, and 
   ◦ system requirements

***!Please Note!***
The Software Requirements Document is <u>*Not*</u> a design document

## User Requirements Documents(URD)

Definition:  User Requirements Documents is also kwon as User Needs. The User Requirements Documents Describes what the user does with the system, such as what activities users must be able to perform.

***!Note!***
A URD is a document  used in software engineering that specifies what the user expects the software to do

#ComponentsWithinURD 
URD often include priority ranking for each requirement.

An Example of a Typical URD may include the following:
   1. Mandatory requirements 
   2. Desirable requirements 
   3. Optional requirements 
   4. Possible future enhancements

## Mandatory Requirements

Definition: A Mandatory Requirement is the <u>Highest priority</u> out of the 4 Requirements within the User Requirements Documents


***!Please Note!***
This Specific Requirement <u>MUST</u> be built into the final system or else the system will not work as intended.

This Requirement is a <u>Compulsory Requirement that has to be part of the bid offer</u>. <u>Failure to meet the requirement means that the bid fails the requirement and will be eliminated from the tender process</u>

## Desirable Requirements

Definition: A Desirable Requirement is <u>a feature that should be built into the system unless the cost is too high.</u>
<u></u>
***!Please Note!***
This means that this Requirement is <u>important but Not Mandatory!</u>

## Optional Requirements

Definition: An Optional Requirement <u>can be built into the system</u>.

***!Please Note!***
The Optional Requirement is a Requirement that is <u>within the scope, but is not necessarily required</u> by the system. 

## Possible Future Enhancements 

Definition: The Possible Future Enhancements <u>may be used in the final system</u>.

***!Please Note!***
The implementation of Possible Future Enhancements <u>Relies on the key factors, The Budget and the Timeline</u>, that leads to the scheduling of future developments of new features in the system

## Requirements Checklist

Definition: A Requirements Checklist is <u>a tool to assist in determining  whether the requirements document is</u>:
     ◦ correct, 
     ◦ complete, 
     ◦ unambiguous, 
     ◦ consistent, 
     ◦ verifiable and 
     ◦ approved.

An Example:
     ◦ Check common language: Make sure every acronym can be found in the glossary or data dictionary.
