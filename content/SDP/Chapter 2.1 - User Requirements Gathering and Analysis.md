## Requirement Analysis

!(Screenshot)[Screenshot 2024-09-02 162248.png] 

The first step of any SDLC Is to Define the Project's requirements.
During this phase we gather(collect) all the relevant information needed to develop a 
product as per customer expectation

## Stakeholders

![[Screenshot 2024-09-02 162708.png]]

What are stakeholder? stakeholders are the ones that have or are interested  in the project's outcome.

Stakeholders can easily influence towards Success or Failure of the Software Project.


#Requirements
 A Requirement specifies what or how the intended service or product should perform.

#ProductRequirements 
A Product Requirement provides all the functions, features and behaviours where the system must possess in order for it to be efficient to use

#RequirementsEngineering
Requirements Engineering is about establishing and managing the requirements

#RequirementsElicitation
Requirements Elicitation is the practice of gathering, researching and verification of requirements of a system.


## What are the requirements to be gathered?

o Business Rule 
o Business Requirements 
o External Interface Requirements 
o Functional Requirements 
o Non-Functional Requirements 
o Constraints 
o etc.

## Business Rules and Requirements

#BusinessRules\
The Business Rule Provides the criteria, condition and exceptions on a specific action.

#BusinessRequirements

◦ Most crucial part at the level of SDLC. 
◦ Provides brief set of business functionalities that the system needs to meet to be successful. 
◦ Define a project’s business need and criteria of its success 
◦ Does not define technical details such as the type of technology implemented in the system. 
◦ Shows no such detail as to how the system will implement this requirement, but rather what the system must do concerning the business.

***!Please Note!***

The Business Requirements are used to implement the Business Rules!!

#### Example

Business Rule: You must be 21 or older to view the alcohol product website. 

(Option 1) Business Requirement: The user shall provide a birthdate as proof of their age.

(Option 2) Business Requirement: The user shall provide a valid drivers license as proof of their age.



## External Interfaces Requirements

• Provide system integration with other components. 

• Identify and document the interfaces to other systems and external entities within the project scope. 

• Belong to functional requirements that are important for systems.


## Types of External Interfaces Requirements

###### ◦ User interface
   ◦ graphical user interface 
   ◦ command line interface 
   ◦ voice-enabled user interface 

###### ◦ Hardware interface
   ◦ what devices the software is created for 

###### ◦ Software interface 
   ◦ database management system 

###### ◦ Communications interface 
   ◦ wireless or wired technologies used to connect devices to one another

## Functional Requirements

#### Functional requirements 
   ◦ Specify what the system should do. 
   ◦ Usually expressed by users. 
   ◦ It describes the system services in details.

#### ◦ Example: 
   ◦ Authentication 
   ◦ Administrative Functions 
   ◦ External Interfaces 
   ◦ Business Rules 
   ◦ Business Requirements 
   ◦ Transaction Corrections


## Non-functional Requirements

#### Non-Functional requirements 
   ◦ Specifies how the system should do it. 
   ◦ Prepared by technician / software architect / analyst. 
   ◦ Provide good user experience, efficient and ease to use. 
   ◦ Also known as quality requirements 

#### ◦ Example: 
   ◦ Performance 
   ◦ Reliability 
   ◦ Usability 
   ◦ Security 
   ◦ Scalability


#### **The system will still work if the non-functional requirements are not met.** 

   ◦ A website that takes more than 30 seconds to load will still meet the function functional requirement but fails non-functional requirement



## Constraint Requirement

Constraints can be business or technical in nature.

Defined as restrictions or limitations on possible solutions. 

Example of constraints: 
   o project budget, 
   o time restrictions, 
   o manpower limitation, 
   o technical architecture decisions, 
   o etc.
